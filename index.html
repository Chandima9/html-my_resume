<h2>Summary</h2> </center>
<p>I am a dedicated materials science engineer with a strong educational background from the prestigious University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka. My passion for innovation and problem-solving extends beyond the realm of materials science, as I am deeply enthusiastic about coding and computer science.

    During my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in materials science principles, enabling me to explore the intricacies of materials behavior, synthesis, and application. Now, I am eager to apply this knowledge to new challenges in the field of computer science.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am a self-motivated individual who thrives on learning and adapting to new technologies. I possess a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach to problem-solving, which I believe are transferable skills that can significantly benefit a career in computer science.
    
    I am excited to embark on a CS-related career opportunity where I can leverage my engineering background, coding skills, and unwavering determination to make meaningful contributions to the world of technology.</p>

    <li>
        Development of cellulose-based nanofibers using electrospinning techniques (Final Year Project) Cellulose based nanofibers enable the creation of advanced drug delivery systems, providing enhanced therapeutic
        efficacy and controlled release of medications. Investigated how waste materials can be used to develop
        cellulose-based nanofibers. 
    </li> <br>
    <li>
        Designed a microfluidic device to synthesize nanosilver particles. It is crucial to healthcare as it provides a
        promising approach to producing antimicrobial nanosilver agents with a high surface area.

    </li> <br>
    <li>
        Designed and analyzed a gearbox for automotive use. The mechanical design of a gearbox was modeled
        and simulated using solid-edge software. Material selection for gear wheels, shafts, and keys was evaluated
        in detail.
